# Python-Image-Mosaics

Image to Mosaic generator written in Python.

It mostly uses PIL and Numpy so it is actually pretty efficient.

How to use:
- You input your mosaics in the folder `/mosaics` (in this case they are images from the game Minecraft.)
- You input your images you want converted in the folder `/input`
- You change the variables `GRID_SIZE` (longest side of the output image) and `CELL_SIZE` (longest side of the mosaic image) to your liking
- You run `main.py` and wait for that to finish
- Look at your results in the folder `/output`

Example input:
